# AcessibleTable

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) . The point was to organized the application accordingly the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/) recommendation, following the acessibility patterns, especially to the blind people, like HTML and all JavaScript code. 

We choose the Angular framework because of the possibilities to access the website through the mobile devices or make it resposive, on the other hand, it would be easy to implement it, once Angular framework handle with components, which were build user centered or base in user experience UX. 

Beside that, Human-computer interaction (HCI), offer the base to develope applications focused  on the interfaces between people (users) and computers. The focus, therefore, to offer the chances to access the website from the devices mobile with the accessility assistant of this devices as well as of desktops devices with screen readers. 

This were just an example of how to adapt an school material or in this case the periodic table to disabilities people, especifically blind people.
